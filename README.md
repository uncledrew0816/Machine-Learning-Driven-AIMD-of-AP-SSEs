Machine Learning-Driven AIMD Study on the Impact of Doping, Defects, and Strain on Diffusivity and Conductivity in Anti-Perovskite Solid-state Electrolytes
This repository provides the open-source data and code accompanying the research article titled "Machine Learning-Driven AIMD Study on the Impact of Doping, Defects, and Strain on Diffusivity and Conductivity in Anti-Perovskite Solid-state Electrolytes."

Overview
In this project, we investigate the effects of doping, defects, and strain on the diffusivity and ionic conductivity in anti-perovskite solid-state electrolytes using a combination of machine learning models and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The study explores various structural and compositional modifications to anti-perovskites and their impact on ion transport properties.
